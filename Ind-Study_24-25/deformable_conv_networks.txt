-Used sampling with eg. 3x3 kernels over the image as a convolution
-Learns the location of where the image should be sampled adaptively. Thus the location where the samples are taken from are condutioned
on the input image
-This means that the convolution isn't done in a 'sweep' but instead applied to relevant areas
-Interesting idea, but isn't really relevant to GSE
