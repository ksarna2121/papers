-This is about a method to learn adaptive kernels called Pixel Adaptive Convolutionals
-They propose a spatially varying kernel that is learned from features relating to the input image
(this map can feasibly be learned from the input image, or could be x,y,r,g,b etc)
-They adapt their 1x1 kernel at each pixel based on f (feature map) where the kernel is a 1x1 slice
of the feature map
-Basically they use outside inforation to create a map that represents the tensor spatially and then take
kernels from this map to apply to the input image as a convolution
