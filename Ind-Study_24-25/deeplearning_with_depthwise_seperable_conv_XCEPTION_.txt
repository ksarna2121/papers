-Based on the idea that cross channel correclations and spatial correclations can be completely decoupled
-i.e each channel can be treated as a separate entity

-Using these things called seperableConvolutional 
-initially a pointwise convolution is applied to the input tensor this gets the tensor to the size we want
-then we do a seperable convolution on the tensor where we seperate the tensor into the number of channels we want
then a nxn convolution is applied to each of these 'slices' of the tensor
-They use residual/skip connections between each layer of seperable convolution

-The way the architecture is laid ut looks very similar to GSE in the sense that the tensor
gets deeper and deeper and the spatial dimensions get smaller and smaller throughout the network
